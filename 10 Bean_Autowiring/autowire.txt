autowire="byType"
steps : 
1) 
ApplicationContext context= new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("spring.xml");  //keeps ready with all the beans available in config file
Triangle triangle = (Triangle) context.getBean("triangle"); //goes to .xml file and searches for id="triangle" and see's autowire="byName"

2)
after seeing autowire="byName" and searches for any dependencies in the <bean>....</bean>
i.e :  <bean id="triangle" class="org.kishan.Triangle" autowire="byName">
  		.
  		.
  		.
  		</bean>
  		
  		//if no such dependencies the goes to Triangle.java and searches for 3 bean name specified in spring.xml file
  		
  		it finds bean with "pointa,pointb,pointc" and automatically refer these bean to those member variable and it automatically autowires them
  		
  		
autowire="byName" and "constructor"
they return only one bean per reqest if multiple reference then it throws exception "exception : expected pointa but found pointa,pointb,pointc;
they both are similar and return on bean at a time
